It has being written in [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) using [StackEdit.io](http://stackedit.io). Published via [GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/@miglen) with [GitHub](http://github.com/miglen) synchronisation. Oftenly distracted by [DevOps Reactions](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/)
