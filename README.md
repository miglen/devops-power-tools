DevOps Power Tools
=======

#### The purpose of this book is to give you an idea of what DevOps is and show you some of the most powerful tools out there. I do not claim that the list is complete neither that this is a guide to become DevOps engineer, but it's a good starting point.

That means you'll need a hell lot of a knowledge and experience to grow in your career, therefore you need to sharpen that blade daily.

## Influence
This book was inspired by [NewRelic DevOps page](http://newrelic.com/devops). The name was given after the infamous book [Unix Power Tools](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003302.do). It has being written in [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) using Notepad++. Published via [GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/@miglen) with [GitHub](http://github.com/miglen) synchronisation. I was often distracted by [DevOps Reactions](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/)
