DevOps Power Tools
=======

This book purpose is to give you idea what DevOps and show you some of the most powerful tools out there. I do not claim that the list is complete neither that this is a guide to become DevOps engineer, but it's a good starting point for that.

## How I end up writing it?
In my daily [work](http://linkedin.com/in/miglen) as Web & Middleware Technical Support Enginner I'm more or less a DevOps engineer. As we all know in the IT area you need to update your knowledge daily, self educate and keep on track with the innovations to stay current. Alongside my work related technologies I wanted to know more about what is beyond the horizon. What the others are using and how they are implementing it.

Primary influenced by NewRelic's [list of devops tools](http://newrelic.com/devops/toolset) and following the logic from the infamous book [Unix Power Tools](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003302.do) from where also I have figured out the title. It has being written in [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) using [StackEdit.io](http://stackedit.io). Published via [GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/@miglen) with [GitHub](http://github.com/miglen) synchronisation. Oftenly distracted by [DevOps Reactions](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/)
