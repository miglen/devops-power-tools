DevOps Power Tools
=======

#### The purpose of this book is to give you an idea of what DevOps is and show you some of the most powerful tools out there. I do not claim that the list is complete neither that this is a guide to become DevOps engineer, but it's a good starting point.

I would like to set the ground basics for DevOps tool set and put you on the second level of [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) - Advanced beginner. If you want to become more proficient you will need to read deeply about the topics that are concerning your position and needs. I realize that this is common sense but wanted to clarify it.

In my work as [Web & Middleware Technical Support Engineer](http://linkedin.com/in/miglen) I'm more or less a DevOps engineer and I'm using most of the tools described in the book on a daily basis. I thought might be a great idea to explore more about the horizons out there what is used to build and maintain some of the greatest on-line services on our time like [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Engineering), [Twitter](https://engineering.twitter.com/) or [Google](http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/) and what the other engineers are using for their daily tasks. While surfing the web for more information I have started gathering lots of unstructured information in my head about what could be used for a specific task. I wanted to structure that information into easy acceptable flow for reading and understanding with lot's of examples, cheat-sheets and useful information.

## Sharpen the Saw
This is a small reference to the book "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" which I'm suggesting you to read it. To be great in your area, especially in the IT sector where everything evolves exponentially you need to learn daily. To be great DevOps engineer you need to be good at development, configuration, system administration, quality assurance and of course IT operations. That means you'll need a hell lot of a knowledge and experience to grow in your career, therefore you need to sharpen that blade daily.

## Influence
This book was inspired by [NewRelic DevOps page](http://newrelic.com/devops). The name was given after the infamous book [Unix Power Tools](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003302.do). It has being written in [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) using Notepad++. Published via [GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/book/miglen/devops-power-tools/details) with [GitHub](https://github.com/miglen/devops-power-tools) synchronisation. I was often distracted by [DevOps Reactions](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/)
